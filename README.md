## Hello world, the name is Jason! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently an Graduate student at Loyola Marymount University! I am passionate about frontend development and game design/development.

Check out some interesting stuff I've made!

### Pirates Code

A fun programming language made for a compiler's class (CMSI3802) during my undergrad. This was a team project made with my friends. Check it out [here](https://github.com/jasoncd31/PiratesCode)!

### Fragment

Fragment is my undergraduate senior capstone project. It was made in collaboration with LMU's Animation department. It was a lot of fun to make and you can check it out [here](https://github.com/jasoncd31/Fragment-Game)!
